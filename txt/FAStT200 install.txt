I've recently struggled to get an IBM FAStT200 (3542-2RU) storage
sub-system working, connected to a couple of AIX servers.  I had
several problems which were undocumented, or documented so badly, that
I thought I'd post something here to help any other unfortunates
trying to do this.  The install and setup should have taken a couple
of days at most, but ended up taking nearly two weeks.

BTW, the disk unit is a re-badged LSI-Logic MetaStor unit, and the
switches are re-badged Brocade units.

I was trying to connect a FAStT200 HA model (the one with 2 FC
controllers), with a couple of EXP500 expansion units (3560-1RU), via
two IBM 3534-F08 SAN Fibre Channel 8 port Switches, to two RS6000
servers (hosts) running AIX4.3.3.  Each server has two FC Adapters
(HBAs) installed (IBM Feature Code 6227).  The idea was to have a
configuration fully resistant to pretty much any single point of
failure - ie: a FAStT controller, disk, cable, switch or HBA can fail
and we can still access the disk from the hosts.

===
Hardware install was straight forward - follow the manuals that came
with the kit.

===
Network configuration:  the switches and FAStT controllers each need
to connect to our ethernet LAN.  The procedure for configuring the
switches is simple and correctly described in the switch install
manual - no problem.  If your switches are connected to a public LAN
(eg: your regular company LAN) the you should secure them by changing
the admin password (passwd command at commandline).  This password is
unlikely to be used often, so take precautions not to forget it!

The procedure to configure the network ports on the FAStT controller
is poorly described in the FAStT Storage Manager Installation and
Support Guide, in the Introduction, and nobody at the vendor or IBM
knew the procedure properly when we raised a support call.  We did not
find the doc as software install is a later step, and so we had not
refered to this manual yet, and no one at the vendor or IBM directed
us to this documentation when we enquired how to configure the FAStT
ethernet addresses.

Furthermore, the FAStT seems to use a very strange network adapter.
The doc says it is 10/100, but doesn't specify duplex behavior.  Our
network people prefer to set the ports that devices patch into to
specific settings, so we tried 100 Full Duplex - didn't work.  IBM
Tech Support said it's a half duplex device, so we tried that - also
didn't work!  By trial and error we found the FAStT network ports
would only work when the port they were patched to was set to Auto
Duplex mode - presumably, the FAStT switches between Full and half
duplex!?!  Nice one IBM, that cost us quite a few days.

Eventually I worked out the following procedure which I believe is
pretty comprehensive:

1. Connect the special FAStT serial cable supplied with the unit to the serial port of the controller card in the FAStT unit that you want to configure.

2. Connect a serial terminal or terminal emulator running on a PC or laptop via a null modem cable to the FAStT serial cable.  You may need a variety of adapters to achieve this (Null Modem, gender changes, etc).

3. Configure the terminal to 9600 Bits/sec, 8 data bits, No parity, 1 Stop bit, Xon/Xoff flow control.  If using an IBM 3153 terminal, setting its emulation to "SCO console" seems to work best.

4. Press Ctrl-Break about once a second until the following prompt appears:
"Set baud rate: press <space> within 5 seconds"

5. Press space bar within 5 seconds.

6. Press Ctrl-Break again once.  Should get following prompt:
"Press within 5 seconds: <ESC> for SHELL, <BREAK> for baud rate"

7. Press Esc key.  Should get the following:

Enter password to access shell:

8. Enter the default password which is infiniti.

9. At the shell prompt enter:
netCfgSet

10. When prompted set the following values:

My Host Name - enter something suitable, such as FAStT200-01A for controller A in the first FAStT200 installed.

IP address - enter the IP address provided by network support for this FAStT

Gateway IP address - enter the IP address provided by network support
for this subnet

Subnet mask - enter the correct IP subnet mask

Network Init flags - enter 0x01 (this set to static IP address.  0x00
sets the FAStT to use DHCP)

All other values                just press enter to leave unchanged

11. Check the values are set in NVSRAM correctly by entering:
netCfgShow

12. Reboot the controller by entering:
sysReboot
Note: this reboots just this controller in the FASTtT.

13. Plug the network patch cable into the ethernet port on the FAStT
controller.

14. Bootup messages will appear on the serial attached terminal.  The
reboot of the FAStT controller is finished when the message sodmain
complete appears.

15. Disconnect the serial terminal.

16. Repeat the above procedure for the other FAStT controller card (if
you have one), using a different IP address.

Cabling up the SAN was pretty straight forward.  The following diagram
hopefully shows what we did to acheive resilience against any single
point of failure:

|HBA   HBA|            |HBA   HBA|

  |  |                      |  |

+-------|-+               +-------|-+
        |                         |
        |                         |
+-------|-----------+-------------|-----+
|FAStT Controller A | FAStT Controller B|
+-------------------+-------------------+

What we didn't realise, being SAN virgins, is that this configuration is actually two seperate SANs.  One SAN is FAStT controller A, switch A and the first HBA in each host.  The second SAN is FAStT controller B, switch B and the second HBAs in each host.  Each host can see both SANs.  Because the Domain ID of each SAN (set in the switches) was the same (factory default of 1), the hosts got confused about how to get to the disks, and we got configuration problems on the AIX hosts.

All the "specialists" that looked at our subsequent problems missed this.  Eventually I figured the problem out myself, and fixed it by changing the Domain ID of switch B to 2.  We did this by telnet or serial connection to the switch, disabling the switch, using the configure command to change the Domain ID, and rebooting the switch, as follows:

### THE SWITCH REBOOTS ###

===
Write down WWN of all adapters.  They're usually written on the back
of the cards.  This is particularly important if your kit is in a
machine some distance away from your desk as ours is (5 miles).

===
Hardware Install Done: at this point we went back to our office to do
the software side of the install and setup.

===
We installed the latest level of support code for the FAStT and HBAs
on our hosts.  In the specific case of AIX 4.3.3 we installed the
latest levels of:
devices.fcp.disk.array.*
devices.pci.df1000f7.*
devices.scsi.scarray.rte
devices.common.IBM.fc.rte
The README for FAStT Storage Manager specified minimum levels, but we
installed the highest available - download from www.ibm.com somewhere.

===
Install Storage Manager on PC running NT and AIX server with X-windows no problems.
The Storage Manager script to disable AVT/ADT requires the FAStT to be rebooted, and the only way to do that is to power off/on or reboot from the serial attach terminal - very annoying when the FAStT box is 5 miles away.  Perhaps there'll be a reboot button in a future version of Storage Manager.

===
Hope this is of use to someone somewhere.  The big problems were:

- configuring network adapters in FAStT,
- Setting the SAN configuration correctly (realising it was 2 SANs and
Domain ID),
- tech support at vendor and IBM not having answers to the problems.
Although they gave some information of assistance, they were unable to
answer specific problems described and observed (yes, they came
on-site a lot).  All problems were solved by us eventually working it
out by trial and error.

To be fair to the vendor at least, I'd say this was more a comment on
the general level of maturity of this product (ie: not much), and the
consequent lack of experience out there, than the ability of the
vendor.  I was, however, very dissappointed that IBMs knowledge-base
was so lacking in answers to clear and specific setup problems.
