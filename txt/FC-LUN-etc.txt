zoning configure on switches  to control which hosts are allowed to communicate with each other.
    > Servers allowed to comm. w/ Storage BUT NOT w/ each other.

example :
    zone name SERVER1
        member fcalias SERVER1
        member fcalias STORAGE-CTRL1
    !
    zone name SERVER2
        member fcalias SERVER2
        member fcalias STORAGE-CTRL1
    !
    zoneset name MY-ZONESET
        member SERVER1
        member SERVER2

== LUN MASKING ==
right LUN presented to right host; if wrong host can connect to LUN -> risk of corruption
=> Zoning only prevents unauthorized hosts from reaching storage system, but not prevent access to wrong LUN if it has access to storage sys.

LUN Masking is config'd on storage sys to lock a LUN down to the authorized host(s)

LUN: Server-1-Boot; Initiator: <ip-server1>
LUN: Server-2-Boot; Initiator: <ip-server2>

===> ZONING ON SWITCHES, LUN MASKING ON STORAGE SYSTEM.


what is a wwpn ?

== Switch Domain IDs ==
Each switch in the FC network will be assigned a unique Domain ID.
One switch in the net is automatically assigned as Principle switch : distributes Domain IDs to other switches.
Each switch learns about other switches and how to route them based on Domain ID.


When server's or storage system's HBA powers on, it sends a FLOGI (Fabric Login) request to locally attached FC switch.
Switch then assigns it a 24bit FCID (Fibre Channel ID) addr.
        FCID = SwitchDomainID + SwitchPort
(?) FCID ~= IP addr. used by FC switch to route traffic.
Switches maintain FCID to WWPN address mapping and which port.


#show flogi database    // show that maintained table.

the FLOGI database info is shared with each switch using the FCNS (Fibre Channel Name Service)

After the FLOGI process is complete, initiator will send the PLOGI (Port Login).
Based on the zoning config, the host will learn it available target WWPNs
Finally init host will send a PLRI (Process Login) to its target storage
Access granted basing on Lun Masking config.
